.Sh NAME
.Nm timer - hyra timer abstraction
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/timer.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The timer registry abstraction allows timers on the machine
to be registered as a generic timer type allowing other parts
of the kernel to request a timer of that type e.g scheduler reserved
timers (TIMER_SCHED). All timers within the system are represented via
a timer descriptor which is simply the
.Ft timer
struct.

The timer struct pointer fields are optional and must
be
.Ft NULL
if unused. Therefore it is the requesting kernel module's responsibility to verify
a field is not unused before using it for obvious reasons.

However, it is highly recommended to set the
.Ft name
field. This field on an HPET timer could be, for example:
.Ft HIGH_PRECISION_EVENT_TIMER
