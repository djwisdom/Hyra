.Sh NAME
.Nm exit, _Exit
.Sh SYNOPSIS
#include <stdlib.h>

[[noreturn]] void exit(int status)

[[noreturn]] void _Exit(int status)

.Sh DESCRIPTION

The exit() function terminates the calling process while calling exit
handlers and performing libc specific cleanups. On the other hand, the
_Exit() function terminates the calling process *immediately* bypassing
internal libc exit routines and cleanup hooks.

The value
.Ft status[7:0]
is returned to the parent process to indicate the reason of process termination.

.Sh RETURN VALUE

These functions do not return
