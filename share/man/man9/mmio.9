.Sh DESCRIPTION
In short, MMIO is a method of writing to registers
of an I/O device via a mapped porition of memory. MMIO
should NOT be done on your own when doing Hyra kernel programming.
Instead, rely on Hyra's MMIO interface and use
.Ft mmio_read<n>()
and
.Ft mmio_write<n>()
functions. Where `n` is 8 to 32 on 32-bit machines, and to 64
on 64-bit machines.

The
.Ft addr
argument can be either a physical address or virtual
address; however, it is recommended to use virtual addresses
for the sake of consistency.
